# PL-Match-Prediction-Model ‚öΩÔ∏è

An archive of a past project where I built a machine learning model to predict Premier League match outcomes.

## üìå Project Overview
- Built a **Premier League Match Prediction Model** using **web-scraped match data** from the **2022/23** and **2023/24** seasons.  
- Focused on analyzing team performance statistics to train and test predictive models.  
- Implemented scraping and preprocessing pipelines to create structured datasets from raw match data.  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status
- The **web scraping portion is currently broken** due to updated restrictions on [FBref.com](https://fbref.com/).  
- The **prediction model itself is complete and functional** with the archived datasets.  
- I may revisit this project in the future to:  
  - Update the scraping pipeline.  
  - Include newer Premier League seasons.  
  - Explore additional features and improve prediction accuracy.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python** (data wrangling, modeling)  
- **Pandas / NumPy** (data preprocessing & analysis)  
- **Scikit-learn** (machine learning models)  
- **Requests / BeautifulSoup** (web scraping, currently non-functional)  

## üöÄ How to Use
